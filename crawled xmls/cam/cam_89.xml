<specsKey name="reviewText">
						This camera is  handy and good for non professionals.Picture quality perfect.Zoom best.But this is battery consuming. I was using normal pencil batteries and while flash is on within three clicks battery is down.Without flash battery exhausted in 15 clicks.Hope there will be some solution to it.
