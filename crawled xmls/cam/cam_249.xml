<specsKey name="reviewTitle">NIkon Coolpix S6400 not working in Cold Countries</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">
						The specifications of the camera looks attractive.But it doesn't work well in cold countries.I brought new one in India and took some snaps,charged it well before my travel and took it to Sweden.When I tried to switch on it doesn't work.So sent back to India to check it.It started working without any repair or service.So again my colleague brought it back to Sweden but its not working now in Sweden.Worst experience with Nikon Coolpix S6400.

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Best buy for non professionals</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">I purchased this cam 2 weeks ago and since then i am testing all it's features. Let me clarify, I am no Professional when it comes to shooting, so I took a little extra time and effort to get used to it's features. Pros:1. The optical zoom is awesome. 2. the vibration reduction feature is really helpful3. picture quality is excellent4. Easy panorama is fascinating.5. very Sleek model6. has a voice memo featureCons.:1. Touch is not much responsive unless stylus is used.2. Gets heated in 20 mins3. Processing of pic takes a lot of time(in case you wanna take continuous snaps)4. The paint feature is not at all useful even with the stylus.5. low battery lifeAll in All, it is a good and handy cam in this range</specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Takes COOOL PICS</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">I had ordered it in flipkart but i got my delivery very very late. i was sad about the delay by flipkart. and finally after getting it i tested it and it is an awesome n best of it's kind cam. best touch sensitivity best zooming and best pic quality. with many and awesome effects. i would suggest this cam to anyone who has d budget range max to 15k. you cant get all the features with full HD mode in any other company cams. so its NIKON or nothing.pros-1.pic quality2.zooming3.special effects4.even 3D mode is available in this cam while other company cam doesn't offer that5. sleek enough to fit in the pocketcons-1.display become warm on little long useover all an AWESOME CAM</specsKey>
