						Got the Nikon D4 from Flipkart when it was not available freely in any part of the world! Yes, Flipkart wrote after about 10 days informing that they will not be in a position to supply and ultimately ended-up dispatching the item. Awesome machine brilliant under low light (high ISO) conditions. I was dilly-dallying between the D800 and D4 and decided to buy this. The first impression is great! However, being an FX format camera need many new lenses!!
