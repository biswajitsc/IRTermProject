<specsKey name="reviewTitle">best camera at this price </specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">
						i  think it's best compact camera with greatest features at this price by nikon . it's pic quality is suberb as it's mega pixels.the only thing lacks is speed . it takes around 5 sec to save photo and also digital zoom is not far good.battery life is good if used rightway i.e 1 day continous photo doesnt drain complete battery. so at all if you more concentrate on pic quality not on speed processing it the best digital camera under Rs 8000 .

						good camera for those who never done photography its 20.1 MP camera gives you good picture quality and its flash helps you to shoot pictures in dark but there is one problem its auto mode sometimes does not work properly when there is no need of flash it flashes up.I get it for Rs.4700.

<specsKey name="reviewText">
						Slimmest body of a digicam ever sen till now, pictures are crispiest and look much more vivid and sharper when seen in an LED, Battery life is also good, overall a worthy buy.......

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Good Camera Bad Software Provided</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">
						Camera is good.But when i connect to the computer running Windows 7,it asks to download software from nikon servers.What a shame?Nikon cant even provide driver software on its cd.My previous sony handy cam and sony camera came with complete installation cd and it was a breeze installing the applications.Nikon should improve and more over flipkart could put effort to verify the products before they sell.Regarding camera,this is my first day and satisfied with performance.Have to wait and see and will write the detailed review after 4 weeks of use.

						This is one bad model and worst compact camera I have ever used... So slow and bad imagining... Macro mode is good for nothing.. Really disappointing... Budget camera is one thing but this model is ridiculous

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Excellent Packing & Faster Delivery</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">Its 2nd order on Flipkart & again they deliver fastly.Camera condition is excellent. tested good shots.8gb sd card & pouch as mentioned in the offer.My firstever point & shoot cameraIn 4600 Rs.Thanks FlipkartAfter 1 week use i have to tell u that if u select highest pixel setting which is starred its result in only increase in size of your snaps select some lowest setting like unstarred 20 MP setting. it give u 5mb (approx) of snaps size.Overall experience with camera is good.Best in daylight condition. You do not expect much in this range of P&S camera. like it will rock in low light. Image is good in low light but u hav tobe prep 4 that.Thank you.</specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Just OK product</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">I have bought this camera to gift my friend on his Wedding. Flipkart delivery is 5 out of 5 again. But not very happy with Camera.Camera is compact and easy to handle, but still looks stylish. Easy menu and you just need to point and shoot. Come with 8 GB memory card and camera pouch. so no need to purchase any thing extra.But pictures are not so good as compare to other Nikon product. Images getting burl with very little motion/shake of your hand. Very hard to click clear piture as we are not profeshional photographer. You either need tripod and need to put on table for still and clear photos. In room lights image are not very clear.Regards,Vikas Shrestha</specsKey>
