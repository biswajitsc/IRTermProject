<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Excellent camera at best price</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">This is an amazing piece from Nikon. Nikon is the leader in the field of camera and this is simply amazing. The battery backup is excellent, with 7x zoom its really amazing. You get a touch screen with this phone which is simply amazing at this price. Nikon has got rid of all the useless buttons that other cameras have and have integrated everything into the touch screen. The stylus pen is amazing and gives an expensive feeling. The photo quality is crisp and the flash is bright. It has several photos modes which is amazing and the video quality is better than many camcorders. The styling of camera is also good and it looks really good in hand. The black colour looks the best. Overall so much features at this price is amazing. Moreover flipcart service and delivery is unmatched. So go for it.</specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewText">
						This camera comes with 16MP & 7x Optical Wide Zoom which is quite nice for beginners. Picture quality is too good & really cool and video also. There are more than 16 individual scene modes. Close up & Landscape modes are really nice. If you compare the price of it with such Samsung, Kodak, Olympus etc. products with same features, you will find that this camera is quite costly than other. But Nikon s6150 is much better with its great performance from others.

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">One Word to describe------Awesome</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">This is my first Digi cam and I had to do a lot of research before buying this camera. No other brand offered 16 MP with 7X zoom, so went ahead and bought it.The initial experience was slow image processing and was first dissapointed.Did a lot of research in the net and understood that the SD card has to be equally good enough to withstand the camara speed so upgraded it with a sandisk 16GB SDHC Class 10 card card the fastest image processor card available with 30MB/S and the camara is now truly awsome. Just keep the 4GB SDHC Class 4 card that comes with the camera aside and upgrade to class 10 SD cards with some extra bucks and u have yourself a good and fast camera.As always flipkart rocks.......</specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Just Go For It!!!</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">Hi all,After doing a great research for a cam ranging around 6-8k about a week, I finally choose this product. And satisfied to the core with this cam.It has all cool features that you expect.Pros:1. 3" Touch screen.2. Can be chargeable directly without removing battery! (like mobiles)3.  20 scene modes including panomara4. You will get an AV cable with this cam, by using it u can directly connect it to TV5. Face detection, Smile Detection, Blink detection, Skin softening Subject tracking, Micro mode, Vibration reduction and many moreCons:1. Little slow processing. May be due to memory stick. better go for 10C card. You will get 4C 4GB card along with camera.About Flipkart:Flipkart is offering this product at lowest price compared to few other sites and stores i've checked. But this time I was disappointed with the delivery, coz, all my earlier items I received in 2-3 days. But I waited for about 1 week for this product. Be aware of it. ;)Anyway Thanks to Flipkart! :)</specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">MACRO MODE DISAPPOINTING</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">HIi'm using this camera for last 2 monthsmacro mode: I have bought this camera for its macro mode which can focus an object 3 cm distance from lens. Yes the lens system has the capability but most of the times the software is not intelligent enough to recognise  the desired object in the frame though it is the range of 3 cm. So that was disappointing to me.flash: flash range is very small only 2 metres  i mean if an object more than that the quality is not good. so in the low light its not good to use zoomZoom: In good lighting conditions the photo quality is very good even at 7x optical zoom and the digital zoom even at maximum level is excellentuser interface: when switches on within 3 seconds it is ready to take photos. and focusing time is also low which is a good thing. But some features are slow. deleting a image is a pain for that i need to press the screen 4 times. and reviewing the last image is not possible (may be a software bug). touch screen: smooth & very sensitive and responsive but i suggest u to use screen guard.over all it is a good camera in its price rangeand of course the flipkart service is awesome </specsKey>
