<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Not Value for money. Nikon disappoints here !!</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">10.1 mp camera with a below average zoom of 3x that too priced at a hefty 9.5k... surely, its a no deal....Pros.good shutter speednice internal memory of around 7.5 gband a few features that wont be of much use for the people who use his kind of cameralight in weightCONSBUIlD FEELS CHEAPfor good pictures, a decent zoom of atleast 5x-8x is required, n not a 3x thingwell, this camera is a mistake by nikonCONCLUSIONYou are not going to invest your money in this thing when you can get things like nikon s6200 for 8.5-9k .. that has a good 16mp camera, 10x optical zoom...i own one for like 10 months, never felt any problem...and you having a 8gb internal is not VERY great, well wud u go for a camera just cause you dont have to carry a sd card??.. well it will be hectic to connect the camera to comp all time :|..it is also pretty light in weight, bt being 40-45gm lighter than a standard thing doesnt make much of a difference to us people who do photography just a hobby...JUST DONT GO FOR THIS. Its not worth the money, i cant understand why nikon even produced it :( DISAPPOINTED BY NIKON :(</specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Compact camera , touch screen, HD camera</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">This is an ultra-compact camera,It is an easy to use, basic features, touch screen interface, HD camera. Touch feel is good. There is a background music playing while slideshow . It has inbuilt storage memory(7.3GB) and no external storage card options. It has inbuilt battery(non-removable) battery. The camera can be charged directly by plugging the camera to the wall socket with the cable(and adapter) provided, just like in mobile phones.There is no tripod provision. The camera is value for the offer price.Flipkart never fails its customers,..... ever.</specsKey>
