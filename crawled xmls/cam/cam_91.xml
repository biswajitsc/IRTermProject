						Things I Like :The optical zoom is very good, better than I imagined.There is a good variety of scene ( Picture mode) selections, which are excellent.Clarity of photos are good.I do not like:The camera takes a longer time to record the image after exposure.The case is same when a frame is deleted.Even though, I would recommend one to buy it.The camera is a good choice between a base model and an SLR.

						The time is over to look after and search the best camera in cool price. This camera is best in its style, performance, photo and video quality. I love its shape. I love its zoom. This cam will give u the exact what u expected as camera should be in such price. It is very easy to handle and very easy in its function. Fully automatic for home users.

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Best Buy @ 13K</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">
						Hi Guys, this is one of the best cameras you get at 13K.Pros:-Its Camera quality n zoom.-The packaged Li-MH batteries can take 300+ shots per pair. And you are provided with 2 pairs...so its freaking awesum.-Connectivity options are good. USB, AV, HDMI- Preset modes really work well like Panaroma, fireworks, sports, etcCons:- It very rarely hangs (happened only once)

<specsKey name="reviewText">
						The camera features a variety of specs as given which is truly satisfy a beginner. The main bad thing of this camera is only the alkaline batteries which lacks performance as expected. But thats not a big deal. I must recommend it to the beginners.

						Good one..... only concern is battery.....Other than that rest all features are good.... I like it.....again its my point of view...Please go ahead and do research before you buy any product....Reviews does help but not always... nowadays we are so used to reviews that even we go for movies after reading reviews which is not good at all... search for different products and choose the best....
