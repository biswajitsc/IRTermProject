<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Pros and Cons</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">Hi, after using this product for 2 Months I am writing my views. First of Pro's:1. Excellent quality (most important)  in this price but be careful adjust focus gently.   it is really very tricky to adjust otherwise you will never get a good quality photo.2. Good Battery Backup.3. Very small and light weight.4. Ruff and Tuff5. Optical Zoom work perfactly.Cons..:1. Not a good grip (many times slip down from hands even still work)2. Very difficult to adjust focus other wise it will give worst quality.3. Some times flash light does not work wait 1 sec then capture again.4. after push capture button it took 1 sec to capture image (should be quick response )5. Only for day uses , in night flash does not give quality after 2 meter.But in last it is really very good product with good quality.you can capture what you can not see by your eyes using optical zoom.. go for it..</specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">It's a failure Model </specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">
						I bought this camera last month and then i came to know that this is a  failure model .   - The main issue is " Battery Exhausted" once you get the message you can't switch your camera again.  - It take too much time between shorts.                                  "  Don't buy any Nikon Cameras"

<specsKey name="reviewText">
						I orderd this camera befor two days and i got it yesterday (in 1 day). Thanks for Quick service from flipkart.Photo Quality:The Nikon S3600 is good for outdoor daytime photography. 8x zoom gives u power to shoot object from long distance. But i m not getting exact result after zooming as it is displays on screen before capturing pic. Photo is blurry and back shaded when zoom in . I dnt know if any special setting is required for this or not.Photo quality is good on normal setting (without zoom).Video qulity is 'Fine' .Overall photo quality is 'Good'.

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Amazing camera, no fault ;-)</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">
						The camera is amazing, if you get a long time to capture the photo, then set the scene mode to auto mode and increase the ISO, Default is 100(i think so), jump to 200... or more to get a snappier pic, but beware! More ISO means MORE GRAIN, so don't go more than 400, i really love this cam, got advanced options (NTSC/PAL, and setting ISO to 3600 and more) which gives you more control as how you Pic finally looks!Happy taking photos ;-)
