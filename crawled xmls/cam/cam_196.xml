<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Review of Nikon Coolpix S3300</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">First things first, I placed the order for this camera through flipkart on Tue 10:55 PM and they delivered it by Thu afternoon. Their packing and delivery system is just awesome. Keep it up.Review about the camera, I did 1 week of research to narrow down to this camera. In a word, its just awesome. There were couple of review comments that said it takes longer time (6-8 seconds) for the camera to store the image and get ready for the next shoot. This is not true, it is less than 3 seconds. I did test this on various shooting modes (only photo not the video)Ease of use: My earlier camera was a Canon Powershot, I have been using that for almost 6 years now, at first with Nikon S3300 I fumbled a bit but within no time I got the hang of it.Quality of Images: Simply superb.Battery Charging: You don't have to actually remove the battery from the camera to charge it, this in my opinion is a really cool feature.Interface: I'm used to Canon's mechanical interface, it is taking  some time for me to adjust on this.Software's accompanying the Camera: I'm an Ubuntu fan, so View NX2 is of no use to me. That being said, Shotwell, a photography managing tool from Ubuntu is all you need. However, I suspect that the post processing for panoramic view will not be possible using shotwell.   My Verdict: Total value for money with no compromise. I would highly recommend this product for people who are transitioning from a beginner to practitioner in photography. </specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">NOT THAT GREAT</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">I bought this camera some time back after going through many reviews and ground work and all.But i have to say my work was not good because after all that i ended up with this piece of junk.It lures you in with its attractive colors and other feature sets and all.but it fails to perform as it is expected to perform.The camera worked well for the first two weeks but then after that it started to crate problems.its responsiveness towards low light settings was pathetic.Also the time for the shutter to close after pressing the shutter release button also was slow.Overall the camera is very slow now and its image processing powers have reduced very much.</specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">very slim and handy </specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">Great cam as compare to Canon PowerShot A 3300 IS Point & Shoot , its has 6x optical zoom , very slim and handy. the image quality is too good with 16 megapixel . and the most beautiful feature of it is its style , Canon PowerShot A 3300 can't beat this in look.the image clearity is too good , the worst part is its speed it takes some time to click another pic , but overall its a good product. the best part of this cam is its macro mode , i clicked a lot of insects , flowers etc pics with a very good quality. for a novice user it may not be a good cam , but for a avg and expert its great. in this range this is the best cam i found.</specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Good Buy After comparing L26 and S3300</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">I just got my hand on Nikon Coolpix S3300 Point & Shoot. First of all Flipkart is unbelievable. I ordered yesterday only. Now about the product. I was confused about buying Nikon nikon coolpix l26 & s3300. Ultimately I ordered this one because i saw some reviews of the both and the pic quality of s3300 (obviously it is costlier) seems to be better. The camera is small and very portable , easily fits in your palm.  Because of Lithium Ion battery it works faster. Its one of the reason I choose S3300 over L26 which uses AA battery. The display screen is just ok. But the digital zoom (zooming a photo) works little slow. I took some indoor pictures with flash. Pictures quality is pretty good and not blurred. Outdoor pictures obviously will be far better. Only thing I did not like is the recording. You don't have a pause option. And recording is only for 8 minutes. I don't know may be it can be changed from settings. But for 6000 bucks its really a good buy.</specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Very Slow Processing</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">
						I have brought this camera some 6 months ago. The quality of picture is good and the look is very attractive. On the whole, the camera is good at this price, but I would also like to mention that the processing of this camera is very slow. It take 8-10 seconds time to click next picture.Nikon should work on this.

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Not worth for the price</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">This piece of product is not up to the mark. Any mobile camera would be much better than this. I am not able to shoot a single snap without shake and noise in a naturally well lit area in my house. Some snaps went absolutely black. No clue what is wrong with this camera.The body material is slippery to handle, you should have the string attached to your wrist not to have this fall down.I have turned off the digital zoon - not even worth mentioning this function.There is significant lag between once you press button and the shutter. Also, significant time taken to save the picture before it gets ready for next one.Seriously, if I had experienced this camera before I wouldn't have ended up buying this for sure.Thumps up for FlipKart, delivery excellence continues...</specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">nice</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">
						it is a nice camera ... but the negative points are 1. it looks bigger on the site but is actually little smaller than expectations.2. Its picture quality is not better than any 8MP camera 3. Its cover is such that if you dont care the camera can fall out if you don t see.however the batter is impressive .the site should have informed that it has a pouch and the 4GB memory free withit. rest all is as expected nothing to boast of
