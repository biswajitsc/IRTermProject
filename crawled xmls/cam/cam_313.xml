<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Awesome Beauty to Capture Memorable Moments</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">Very Good Camera in its range. Absence of Low Pass Optical Filter indeed makes a difference in photos. I have N3200 and now I own N3300 too. N3300 is Just awesome.Price Quoted in Flipkart by other Sellers (Not WSRetail) seems to be more than local market. Nikon in fact provides u with a DSLR Bag and 4GB Memory Card along with these camera for Much Cheaper price almost 3k less than current price in Flipkart !!!I also have heard that if purchase made in online, Nikon fails to provide warranty. Pl go through Nikon site for warranty. Its better to buy from authorized nikon outlets than from online so that our penny spent seems to have some safety in respect to after sales and service.Currently nikkon provides some offer for new purchase of camera go through nikon site.I recommend this product to others. My Suggestion wait till WSRetail makes this product available or buy in you local authorized shop.Happy Nikkoooorrrrring !</specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Awesome camera & Absolute Steal at  Price Rs. 29999/-</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">I bought this camera on April 4th 2014. •  I recommend the Nikon D3300 to everyone who asks what camera to buy for great photos of family, friends, sports, concerts, theater and action.•	Got kids and want great action, low-light and long-distance photos? The D3300 is the camera to get. Paying more won't get you much more other than a lot more weight to have to carry around.•	The built-in flash is excellent. You probably don't need a separate flash unless you're trying to shoot action or kids which demand a fast recycle time.•	The included 18-55mm VR II is probably all you need for everything. If you're new to photography, the strongest advice I can give you from 45 years of experience is that it's far more important to learn how to use what you've got, instead of confusing the issue by buying more lenses, as you're starting out.•	Personally, I usually use the 35mm f/1.8 DX for everything and leave the 18-55mm VR at home.•	The D3300's LCD is big, bright, sharp and color-accurate. You couldn't really put a bigger or better screen on a camera this small.•	Like most DSLRs, the battery lasts forever. The biggest worry you should have is being lulled into forgetting to bring your charger on a long trip.•	New in the D3300, a swept panorama mode lets us hand-hold and swipe the D3300 in any of four directions to make a 180º panorama.•	Color rendition is superb; the D3300 uses all the same picture controls, with matching results, to all the other current Nikon cameras.PROS: Small for a DSLR; Retracting lens makes camera compact; Sharp, clear images with accurate color; Video has smooth movement; Great priceCONS: No tilting LCD screen; Limited shooting controls.VERDICT : The Nikon D3300 is an excellent entry-level camera for aspiring photographers, delivering a good feature set and high-quality images.</specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Its Deinitely better than Canon 600d</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">Canons have good color reproduction and the photos look really good on the camera screen but when zoomed they are not as sharp as Nikons and Canons produce more noise compared to Nikon especially when comparing 3300 and 600d in the Low light. Canon is more famous because of it is easy to use as well as good marketing programs such as Loyalty Programs which makes you buy Canon again and suggest your friends to buy canon, more like Network Marketing but Nikons are more sharp especially when cropped at 100% Nikon are more sharp and have Less noise. Other reason why Canon is more famous because the people who buy a DSLR Camera are 80% enthusiasts and 20% or less professionals. A non proffestional want an easy to use Camera while Proffessionals are more concerned about picture quality. These 80% can become proffessional at some point they may choose their previous brand . so there are more Canons than Nikon. Comparing D3300 and 600d , D3300 is a new camera,  Faster autofocus with Expeed 4, more megapixels 24MPX vs 18MPX , 5fps vs 3.7fps , good performance in low light- Low noise at 1385 ISO vs 793 ISO  and 60fps vs 30fps  D3300 is a clear winner. If you still have doubts, goto Dxomark.com and get the scientific test results and Search in google that "Nikon d3300 flickr" goto group pool open the images at 6000x4000 resolution and compare them with 600d by doing the same.</specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Awesome..........</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">I've purchased D3300 @ Nikon authorized dealer in Pune, 2 months before and price was just 2000 extra to compared with flipkart.some people are very eager to write here,and they say this camera is for beginner.......beginner?? ....oh come on......this is very high quality product for professional purpose also.this camera comes with 18-55 Nikon VR2 lense which is extremely stable. But there is huge deference in VR1 and VR2 lenses of Nikon.so please don't purchase 55-200mm VR1......it is very low quality lense. and it is very uncomfortable & risky to swipe lense again & again while on tour.Please note VR2 telephoto lenses are very costly.so try 18-200mm tamron which is not that good but can be used in all condition zoom while traveling and you can avoid any damage to camera body.About D3300??This is really awesome camera, I took some extraordinary photos with this......it took time to learn after reading some books and training......but now no word to explain.I took some moon photos with 55-200mm lense, which need a steady tripod, perfect settings and i can see moon craters clearly but in 100% crop.One more thing.....dont use low quality cheap filters on lenses.....you'll loose photo qualty. try to get filters from Hoya made.Enjoy the photography....</specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">My First DSLR (Awesome Feeling)</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">Initially i was bit confused between D5300 & D3300 but after doing some intensive research i decided to buy D3300.The product got delivered within 24 Hrs. Thanks to Flipkart...!!!This camera shoots very high quality stills & records 60 fps 1080p videos.With the price difference of 15k between D5300 and D3300, i would suggest people to go for D3300 and add some beautiful lens to your kit eg: A must have 35mm Nikkor Lens   55 -200mm VR Nikkor Lens).Will share more in detail after few weeks of usage.For now i am very satisfied with the product & the service provided by the Flipkart.</specsKey>

						Just bought few days back so sharing early experienceIQ is fantastic Easy handlingQuick focus ( a problem in most of the entry level DSLR)New processor by Nikon seems real fastRetractable lens is quite goodVery handy guide mode for beginners I have not used any other one so cant actually say about the IQ of others.I feel articulated LCD would have been quite a good  introduction in this modelOther wise loving the came :) Buying experience was quite frustrating . most likely i am not gonna buy an expensive item from Flipkart.
