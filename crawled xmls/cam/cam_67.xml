<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Judge Yourself! Though I â™¥ IT :)</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">I just got the delivery of my new Coolpix L26. Just 6000+/- [inclusive of the 2800 mAH batteries]... you cant ask for more. Wait a sec - they did give more gifts :)+ a camera pouch  [Rs. 190/-] + 4 GB SD card    [Rs. 200/-]+ Battery charger [Rs. 170/-]1. Remarkable is the AA battery option.[10/10]I have seen on many occasions my friends camera lasted only about 200 shots... if you think that's a large number, it not!hardly 1 hour of photoshoot, which if you are on tour... is nothing.L26 lasts about 500+ shots with my 2800 maH batteries.2. Brilliant automode performance in daylight and night mode aint bad either.[9/10]Now for those who are fooling others by boasting about 21 in-built modes... dont bother! most of the ppl dont even try to use those options unless they want a panorama snap. But the auto-mode works fine, so need not to worry. 3. Indoor pics arnt as clear as i wanted them to be.[In short 8/10]Grainy images spoiled my mood little bit but then i fixed some options and its satisfactory now.4. Dont zoom much, it wont help!5. The shutter speed is amazing and it hardly takes 1 second to process the image you just clicked so... that's awsm.All in all... gr8 product for around 6000 K...If you want to complain, i would like to point out.. "WHY NOT BY A DSLR then :P "</specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">A good portable camera</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">You get what you pay for.I bought this camera to use it for outdoor activities where my DSLR would be too big to carry. Like during cycling, trail running to capture those moments. - The camera has till now performed very well in good daylight, but the low light performance leaves a lot to be desired (expected in this price range).- The size of the overall package is another reason why I bought it. It is small and compact enough to carry around without feeling the weight.I shot video with it and as long as you do not shoot hand held, the quality is good. Though video is not something I use a lot, I think I will shoot more after seeing the output this small camera can produce.The camera looks a bit plasticy and I expected a better finish on the body. My older outdoors camera was a DSC W5 from Sony and it was an all metal body.I liked the fact that this came bundled with a 4GB memory card and rechargeable batteries and its charger. Helped me get going immediately. While on the topic of batteries, the camera is holding its charge really well and I haven't had to recharge it, as yet. </specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewText">
						ny other company ready to give specs like this? 16.1mp 5x zoom hd recording at rs.5500 suerly go for this one as it is the best in the range .The images are clear and sharp. Recording is too good. The flash is good. and it fits nicely in your hand.

<specsKey name="reviewText">Delivery: 5 Stars (record time)Product: 4 Stars (details below)Ease of use - 4 Stars (Pro: Distinct Video button)Picture Quality - 4 Stars (Display 3 stars, grainy dark pictures, overexposure, Full screen pictures pretty decent 4 stars, Outside shots good colors 4 stars)Zoom - 4 Stars ( Optical zoom pretty neat, digital zoom too sensitive on handheld mode)Internal Memory: 5 Stars Surprise (didnt expect at this price point)Screen 3 inch: 5 Stars (beats competition)Accessories: 3 StarsWatch !! Good SurpriseBattery and case: basic but sufficeWarranty: 4 Starsno Surprises hereOverall: 4 starsValue for money, pretty neat for a basic camera and a steal at 5K price point. Few of the 16 MP 5X camera at this price range. Beats competition (canon and cybershot) at this price point. Fuji is not a competition with Nikon coolpix (confusion about there warranty policy as well!). Complete set with rechargable batteries, memory card and case, so start using on day 1. Easy interface makes this a first choice, specially since I expect my parents to use this a lot.Thanks!Abhinav</specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewText">
						Well Flipkart service is exceptional...!Not really happy with the clarity of the pics taken (L26) at 16 M.P . pics taken  at 8 MP through mobile is much better. Wouldn't recommend this particular L26 model to others.

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE PRICE</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">I shall rate the various features in 1-10 scale:1.Looks,Finishing and style :Pretty good from the front but plastic panel at the back,which looks a bit cheap. (7/10)2.Picture Quality: The picture quality is good.Its gives decent images in low light conditions also.(8/10)3.HD Video Recording : Sorry to say its not as expected. The video appears to be bit grainy and i m not that impressed.(6/10)4.Flash and Night Mode : The flash is powerful enough.I tried taking snaps in complete darkness and the camera gave good results. (9/10)5.Battery Capacity : It has a flexible battery facility ie., both Ni-mH and normal alkaline batteries work. So even if the rechargeable Ni-mH is out , you can continue shooting using easily available AA alkaline batteries. (10/10) </specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewText">
						no doubt about the product n flipkart service ..... they are gudbutif someone is attracted by the offers, then he/she must think twice before buying....Actually , 4  batteries r given wid the camera n they are just the "demo" batteries and  r not rechargeable at all. After few pics click they will get exhausted. Meaning thereby u hv to buy the separate rechargeable batteries.I was surprised by this as i didn`t found these things mentioned anywhere before buying.thts all.and hope not to get more surprises...
