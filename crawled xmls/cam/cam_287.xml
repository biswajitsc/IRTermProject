<specsKey name="reviewTitle">I am half satisfied</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">Flipkart did good job in delivering the product on time. The product is perfect, except the addon free bees they promised to send. One of them was Camera Pouch. This Pouch was smaller than the camera - so the pouch was not meant for the camera I purchased - How strange!! I called Flipkart customer care, but they told that this free bee was added from the manufacturer's side, so I better call Nikon customer care. I did the same, while they told it's Flipkart's responsibility to deliver right product, they can't take care of this issue. They also added that Flipkart is not their authorized dealer. So, it has ended up into a blame game. I expect perfection in product delivery from Flipkart. This was not expected. Hope Flipkart team can do something in this case and going forward to take care of such issues.</specsKey>

						i bought this camera yesterday, awesome picture quality, far better than other point n shoot cameras, good in low light, CMOS sensor is superb, 18X zoom clearity is also very clear, but stability of any object only works when flash is on, if flash is not on then motion picture will blur ......

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Best Camera</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">This is the best camera at this price. And to my surprise its features and performance it is better than any other camera in sub 20K bracket. I compared it with Sony, Panasonic, Cannon and Olympus before finalizing this one. The 18.x zoom is awesome and has literally no lag. Also the picture quality is superb and the colors are vivid and lively and image is very crisp and sharp and in some cases better when compared with my friends cheap SLR camera. Captures extremely nice images in low light conditions.It also has multiple shooting and editing modes. The best feature of this camera is it is charged directly like mobile and does not require a separate charger for battery.If you are looking to buy a camera, go for it.</specsKey>
