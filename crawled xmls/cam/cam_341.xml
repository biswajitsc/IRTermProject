<specsKey name="reviewTitle">A Great Companion</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">It was time that i switched to a full frame camera. I had almost made my mind to go with D700 and just then Nikon announced the release of D600 for a lot more reasonable price with great features.The U1 U2 feature is the best feature added by Nikon which is not available in D4 and D800's. Gives great result in low light and very less noise when you bump the ISO to over 6400.The camera body has an inbuilt focus motor which means you can invest in cheaper lenses like 70-300 (Non VR) or a 50mm lens which is a manual focus lens.The camera is heavier than the entry level 3100 and 5100 and lighter than D800. The weight acts in advantage as it reduces camera shake a lot of times.24 Mega Pixels is more than enough to use the image as a banner and becoz of the Mega pixels, the Jpeg fine file format goes to 8mb and the RAW format is of 30mb. So better invest in some good hard disc to store the huge files.The dust issue on the camera's sensor is the only annoying thing with this model. You need proper servicing of the camera (From nikon service centers) if you take this camera to shoot a wedding or a portfolio near a sea shore, moisture or dust areas.</specsKey>
