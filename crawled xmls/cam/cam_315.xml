<specsKey name="reviewText">
						I am not a photographer and usually used my smart phone to take pictures and limited in my experience before using this awesome NIKON product.It comes with 'AF-S 18-55 mm VR Kit Lens II' lens and i purchased the combo offer in which i got another lens of high range 'AF-S 55-200 mm VR Kit'. Frankly speaking although i am not a professional photographer but as the experience is with this camera i am going to be one after few days.I will definitely suggest anyone to go for it if you really want to have an awesome photography experience.

						4 out of 5Nikon D3300: looks good, the 24mp is of course attractive, but the menu driven system mostly is a put-off for me (I would have liked some more physical controls). The 95% viewfinder coverage is also not good and the so many auto settings not good for me either. You need to question whether you really need the 24mp (I personally do not print large photos and do not either crop a lot).
