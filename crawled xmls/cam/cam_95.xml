<specsKey name="reviewTitle">flipkart - awesome (maybe very good if not awesome ) camera - not good</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">
						the delivery done by the flipkart was as usual very good....but the camera wasn't worth the money..       1.for this price range you can get cameras with more optical zoom      2.it has alkaline batteries which have to be cahrged after using for approximately 1.5 - 2 hours (other cameras at this rate have lithium ion battery)  3. the automatic focus sucks..   4.if u are interested in photography and need a camera with less expense i suggest you to buy cannon cameras (donno the specifications) u can get manual focus with them
