<specsKey name="reviewTitle">A good entry level digital camera</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">Flipkart maintained standards and delivered L27 within 3 days. L27 is my first digital camera. Habituated of the simplicity of a phone camera (I own samsung galaxy note) and the touch screen, the first day with this new toy was frustrating. But after going through the camera manual, I am now convinced with my purchase. Specification wise it is same as L26 though with a smaller screen, but is almost 400 Rs. cheaper. Initial photos were a bit shaky, but as the day passed I was able to take some decent pics. Pouch is nice but without a strap. Over all I am quite satisfied, and will recommend to those who want a decent camera at cheap price. nice one to learn basics of photography</specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">As per Nikon Customer service,Don't buy Online.</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">I bought NIKON Digital  L27 camera on 21st of Oct 2013 from flipkart.Everything was going fine with it till last week of July 2014 when I found some lining marks on LCD screen of the camera.I thought it was because of the low battery and ignore it. But after two weeks (Aug 2014) if found a large black spot on LCD screen.I went to the Nikon service Centre PUNE (Surana services) on 30th of Aug 2014 and told them the problem. Instead of providing me the free service (because the camera is still under warranty) they ask me to pay 2250 as a replacement charge for LCD because the defect doesn’t come under warranty. I don’t know why it doesn’t come under warranty. The representative name is PRAKASH.When I contacted the customer care number of NIKON, a lady named MANISHA was there for my help. I told her my problem and the  response from her was “Sir, we don’t encourage our customers to buy our product ONLINE. As you buy this product from flipkart, we are not sure about the quality of the product”.And when I question her that why you guys sell your product online(flipkart) if you are not sure about the quality that flipkart is providing, the answer was “we can’t do anything sir. You have to pay the amount whatever the service Centre guy is asking”My question is to the Nikon personals that if you don't trust online sites then why are you allowing them to sell your product and defame your name?</specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewText">
						Three months of nominal usage and the flash is down. Sometimes it flashes erratically without any command and with a command refuses to fire! Thoroughly disappointed with the product. A slap on the face of  Nikon's brand value. Hope they are listening.

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Best Budget Nikon-Camera; has cheaper variant(pink/silver)</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">PROS:[+] Amazing picture quality in daylight.[+] Very portable due to its small size and lightweight,the strap provides good hand grip[+] Strong flash : really useful in cloudy or evening time.[+] Software : makes easy to port images from camera to computer(Windows: XP,7,8 tested, Linux: Unbuntu tested, Mac not tested )[+] Best budget digital camera.CONS:[-] To recharge, the battery case need to be opened every time[-] Image quality is poor if taken in night[-] Image quality is poor if taken in excessive/direct light exposure e.g. sunNote: Buy a pair of rechargeable AA battery (I received as I bought it during offer period) along with a charger to make photographic experience smoother :D . </specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewText">
						I have recently purchased it and its a good deal at a cheaper price.I have had used Sony cybershot and a Cannon point & shoot cam. and this one comes with loads of  features at a decent price.It has hd video recording and quality is much better.It can be easily carried anywhere you go.A very handy product.My Blackberry(curve) does not have a very good image quality so, i had to purchase it and I think every penny i've spend on it, got its worth.
