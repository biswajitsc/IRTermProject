						Got Nikon S4200 recently. Looking good and the touch feature is great at such a low priced camera. Pictures and videos are awesome. However found 2 disadvantages that is on the negative side. 1. Around 4 secs lag to shoot the next picture which is really irritating and you could miss the timely shots. Also, shutter speed is not adjustable.2. Getting heated up quickly when using for some time, I am not sure if this is common. Otherwise great camera to start with and worth for the price and you cannot expect wonders with low priced cameras.
