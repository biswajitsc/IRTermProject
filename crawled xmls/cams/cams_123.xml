<specsKey name="reviewTitle">ZOOOM BOSS</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">
						extremely good product. 60 x zoom is what attracted me  to the product. and also the pricing which is quite affordable considering you want such good zoom. I dnt think any other brand offers it in this price range and Nikon can't be compared to others.Only thing I found a little disheartening was that the autofocus on the subject while zooming is a tad slow compared to other cameras and even compared to Nikon L830 which has 30x zoom. Otherwise its cool. The multivariangle display is coolif you are looking out for a zoom monster and dont want a dslr this is the product to choose

<specsKey name="reviewText">
						Few days back we visited Singapore and felt that our many of the memorable shots are not coming correctly just because of camera. We did lot of research and found 2 options for myself 1) D SLR 2) Point &amp; Shoot CameraAfter a detailed research we found Nikon Cool Pix 600 and found value for money and best device in the segment. The level of zoom it has and other capabilities will make you mesmerised. Amazingly superb device for novice users.

						If you are not a professional photographer  then this camera is for you. Excellent performance and great delivery by flipkart. If someone has seen moon videos of this camera on youtube..then they dont lie. I managed same quality video from this. Best utility is camera remote control through ipad or android device.. works great

						a very nice camera for the price. it has awesome zoom and very good functions. I wanted a camera only for zoom purpose as I already have a DSLR, so i found this to suit my needs and budget. Only flop side was Flipkart having promised an offer of 8GB card plus camera pouch with the product, and the pouch i received was of some other digital P&amp;S camera, more so of the small sleek types. the pouch hardly measures 4inch by 3inch size, obviously not for p600.Flipkart should note what products they are shipping and what offers they are giving before shipping
