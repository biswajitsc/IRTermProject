<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Great camera bt got some cons BEWARE !</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">
						This camera is great for taking photos but 1. Lacks a articulating touch screen which is present in its rival model of canon 2. Lacks large buffer capacity.3. The autofocus is not so great.sometimes the pictures may be out of focus while shooting wildlife or birds in flight.4.cannot control the aperture in live view mode.5. No wifi . So cant upload photos directly on the internet.no gps as well. 6. Has got 7fps only in 1.3 x crop mode.If you want to shoot wildlife and birds go for 7d m2 or 70d.
