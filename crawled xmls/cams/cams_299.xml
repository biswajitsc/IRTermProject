<specsKey name="reviewTitle">The best DSLR for starters</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">Have used this camera for about 2 years now. The best camera for first time DSLR users. A very good in-built guide to get your first pictures right plus a host of modes for various shooting scenarios. The 18-55 lens is quite adequate for both wide-angle (group photographs) to a decent zoom. The auto-focus function works well in ambient light conditions. The in-built flash is just about adequate for portraits. The camera focus/response is slow in low light conditions and the in-built flash fall short which are the two main issues.The bundled software is excellent.Have not had any complaint with the camera and have never faced a reason to take it to a service center. Overall; an excellent investment which will reap benefits for its owner for many years.</specsKey>

						A Great DSLR Entry Camera, Guide Mode is the best thing about it for beginners. 18-55 Kit Lens got a great Clarity for your pictures. Slight Disappointing during night or long Exposure shots, but can be settled with a tripod.GREAT VALUE for Money, at 24K's you must go for it.Got Loads to offer then its competitor CANON EOS 1000D.The Main Drawback of it is NO VIDEO.But you can always go for its upgrade the NIKON D3100 just spending 1K's more.

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">A great buy and excellent service</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">
						The service was great as usual from Flipkart - the camera was delivered within 48 hours of ordering.This is my first DSLR camera, and I think its great for beginners like me. There is a guide mode which is helpful for those who are new to photography and do not understand what settings to use under what circumstances.All in all, I think this is a good buy and I hope to capture many memories.

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Good entry level camera</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">
						A good entry level camera..Best feature is its lowest cost but problem is its just 10.2 Mp.. Performance in low light situations are bad even with hi 1.. Apart from that you get the control over image just like any other dslr..Has all d basic features that you need to master as an amateur..
