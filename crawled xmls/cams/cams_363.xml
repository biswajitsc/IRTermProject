<specsKey name="reviewTitle">How is it better than the P300? Here is the info..</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">
						Nikon's P300 and P310 are both great cameras. The few key upgrades from P300 is the 16 Megapixel (marketing gimmik) and the video file formats. What caught my eye were the video file formats, useful!Note: Its a compact camera at 1/4th the price of a DSLR and hence don't compare the image quality

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Good Product</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">
						Received this product with some freebies like 4 GB memory card, HDMI Cable and Camera Pouch those are not mentioned in the site. Good service from flipkart. The video quality is awesome at 1080(checked in HD TV) and could not see any issue even recording on class 4 memory card.
