<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Nice product,easy carry and low range.</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">I bought this camera 5 days ago from Great Eastern Trading Co, Kolkata. I am here to help you customers who are thinking to buy this product or can't decide.About Nikon S2700:--Pros :-1. Good 16.1mp CCD image sensor, produces great quality image &amp; accurate colours in bright light. Being a very cheap &amp; entry level CCD, low light picture is not superb but it's decent.2. Loss-less optical zoom, excellent image even in 6x zoom. Digital zoom is good also(4x).3. HD video can be recorded when zoomed.4. Very handy, slim, light weight &amp; beautiful design.5. USB charging when connected to a computer or AC adapter (multi USB).6. It got everything it should have at this price.Cons :-1. Battery is small &amp; not very powerful. It's 220 shots or 25 mins HD video can be taken/recorded when fully charged.2. Its image stabilization feature has some problem so sometimes (not always) produces less sharp images (when viewed in full resolution) even in steady shot mode. But it is decent and manageable.Others :-1. Its built quality is good enough but not upto the mark.2. Has no pause option during video recording. It's actually not a disadvantage because none of the cameras in this price range has this feature. They all produce video clips only.3. 2years warranty.Inside the box :-Camera, battery, 4 GB SDHC memory card, USB cable, AC adapter (AC-UB 10C), power cord, AV cable, wrist strap, user manual, warranty card.</specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewText">
						I bought it looking at the brand and cost. Assumed it would click decent pictures. But for my dismay the picture quality isn't that great. My samsung mobile takes a better picture. Lot of disturbances in the photos. could find the disturbances when i did 20% zoom in. Bought this April 2013 and now the camera is gone for a lost. There seems to be a big problem.

<specsKey name="reviewText">
						i got this camera from flipkart with very fast delivery service, with nice packing and with UCB watch, 4 GB memory card  camera pouch and strap, this is an small wonder with lots of functions, battery back-up is very good you can take 200 shots with a single charge lot of picture modes are there.  but there are one problem with this product it is little bit slow when we taking continuous shots it take  little time to records first image and then take another image. you can go for it if you have tight budget

						Nikon's new S2700 is a good product. Though there are no new features that make it stand out, but if you are looking for a digi cam for under INR 6K. This is wat u should buy....Pros: Picture quality is very gud.... 16 Mega is good for screen viewing. Cons: I found one drawback - its slow at the time of deleting pictures.....

<specsKey name="reviewText">
						I bought this camera recently, and have been using Sony's Digital Cameras until now. There is a distinct difference between Sony and Nikon products. It starts from everything like picture quality, battery back up, processing time for consecutive pics etc. Unlike Sony camsNikon does not offer you any verity of shooting mode, I would stronly suggest NOT to go for this camera, instead buy a SONY
