<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Worth the penny</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">Ordered this on Monday early morning and I had it delivered to my work place by Thu early morn. In fact the courier guy had come to my place on Wed but I was not there. For the camera is concerned - its really worth the value you pay for it. Good features, AV cable, works even in Linux directly. No pre-configuration is needed. The battery life also seems to be good. People bothered with file size of the images, make sure you reduce the resolution.Click the pics and keep moving, dont even stand there for a moment and there is no glitch in your pictures. It also has a Tripod slot which makes your geek stuff more going. Overall - this is my first gadget that I shopped from flipkart, n I would say - its good. Superb packing to  prevent the camera from damage, everything loaded as mentioned in the site and in great working condition. Thanks.  </specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Good but not the best</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">Recently got this camera (Oct 2011) and must say the purple color looks quite nice without looking too girly. The camera is quite slim and looks really fab with the metal body and the glossy paint finish.what I LIKE about the product:1. Looks expensive and attractive2. Easy to use 3. Good build quality with switches and plastics feeling durable4. Various pre-set modes and scenes available, makes life easier for a novice. Camera works quite well when left to auto mode5. Good quality snaps and I have managed to click some real good ones with this.6. Both optical and digital zoom (5X) work well and macro mode is quite effective specially when used properly.What I DONT like:1. No Optical stabilisation. Meaning that when used without flash, your images will usually come blur due to vibrations from hand. A tripod is a must. This spoils the experience according to me as I HATE blurred images.2. Manual focus option has to be selected again after each click as the focus freezes in place once set for the first click. So if in my subsequent snap i want to refocus, I got to select the option again. Its purely irritating and stupid.Conclusion - A good VFM product if you are a novice or if this is your first camera. Easy to use and looks nice. I got this for my mom so it works fine in that role. But if I was to pick something for myself, I would skip this and pick up the Canon A3300 probably for a bit more dough. </specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Worth the money paid… Flipkart delivery works on Sundays as well..!!!!!!</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">hi all ,        got this beautiful small yet powerful digicam delivered to me on Sunday which was not expected but surprised and feels good .Thanks flipkart for making my Sunday…about the S3100. I am happy with this product against the amount paid. It cannot be the best but is worth the price and the free gifts are also of good quality and good looks. Superb image quality  , very compact (looks like a toy camera at the first look) , TV/AV cable , charger , battery ,memory card are addons to it. Not to forget , Flipkart has done a superb packing , even if you throw it from a 10 story building the camera will be un affected with this kind of packing.May be I am wrong but the HD video records only upto 20 seconds..!!!! however if I turn to a vga  mode it increases the time length upto 25 minutes . maybe I have to read the manual to change the settings.. otherwise it’s a lovely piece with no regret tag </specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">A very good camera for an affordable price</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">
						I received the camera in 2 days after ordering it at Flipkart. The camera is for less than Rs. 7000/- and it packs 14MP which is very good for this price. The camera is slim and you can see the lens protruding upto 3 tiers. Very sleek to use. The camera has a 4x optical zoom and 5x digital zoom. The picture quality is great while you are using the optical zoom but if you use the digital zoom to click a picture the sharpness is not so good. In macro shoot (I used it for close up product shoot) the picture clarity is great (if you use a tripod. Highly recommended if you don't have a hugh budget.
