<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Unpleasent experiance with Flipkart this time</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">I ordered this camera with Seller called "LOOT LO". I was suspicious with this seller name but I got confirmation from Flipkart saying it's a genuine seller.I ordered this camera but surprisingly somebody called flipkart and cancelled my order on my behalf “Note from flipkart.. Customer called and cancelled”. When I saw such emails and messages, I called customer care and this time I got it ordered by flipkart executive.almost the same time...I got a call from seller, who was located in Bangalore, saying all cameras got ruined due to heavy rain last night when I asked him to get in touch with flipkart and let flipkart people confirm it me. He became arrogant saying why I am ordering again and again.Seller again called flipkart and cancelled on my behalf. And also kept calling me not order again. I had to again call Flipkart, escalated it their senior managers, shared seller numbers then they changed the seller to WS Retails. Finally I got my product..I never thought of facing such hassle on Flipkart but don’t know why Flipkart is allowing fake sellers.It could be due to their monetary benefits but FlipKart is definitely losing it’s credibility.</specsKey>
