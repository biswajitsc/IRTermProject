						Hey guys , i got a nikon coolpix about a year ago . Well its a decent camera thats what it is nothing more. You will get shaky, blurred images trust me no matter how steady you keep your hands. So nothing really special about it. There are lots of better cameras of sony or better casio or cannon ...If you buying it because of Nikon brand name , you will regret it , trust these low end are not upto mark . So thats about it . Thanx for reading and bye .:)
