						I purchased Nikon Coolpix S9600 Point &amp; Shoot Camera it worked good but some manufacturing defect is there in the product. However Flipkart is arranging refund, but would like to mention here that product is very good in use, good quality of pics easy to handle. I will rate this product more than 5 stars. It is good for personal use for family picnic, party tour etc.
