<specsKey name="reviewText">Great delivery by Flipkart within 24 hours of ordering. But one minor issue - instead of Micro HDMI Cable, the box has Mini HDMI Cable. Called up the customer service and now am expecting a callback in 24-48 hours from Flipkart.Camera has been awesome looks and quality wise. Charged for 2 hours and took few snaps. Good number of accessories cables have been provided.This is my third camera in the last 10 years and am just amazed at how feature rich these models are these days.Recommend this, not for the Wi-Fi feature, but for the CMOS sensor + Full HD video recording.UPDATE on HDMI Cable Issue: Flipkart &amp; WS Retail representatives called me up and finally Micro HDMI cable has been dispatched today. Great customer service by Flipkart &amp; WS Retail. I would definitely love to buy more products from Flipkart &amp; WS Retail in future.</specsKey>

						Bought with the expectation of a good product &amp; cheap price but made a mistake. I received a faulty product &amp; had to go through servicing it with Nikon. The service was pretty pathetic as well &amp; took a long time.But the product works OK now, I would recommended a different brand

<specsKey name="reviewText">
						the brand "Nikon" only makes cameras and that's why you can trust it anywhere anytime.I have purchased this product from a reputed electronics shop from my locality and i am very satisfied. As I'm not a photographer, i did not want a DSLR. I went for a point&amp;shoot and got the best product.. the only con of this camera is it's battery backup is not so good but ok.Overall I will recommend this product to every beginners ... for everyday use its very nice and classy.. I love my Nikon..
