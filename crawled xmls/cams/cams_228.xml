<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Video recording supported upto 8 minutes only!!!</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">
						Processing of this camera is obviously slow as it takes 5 to 8 seconds to get ready for another shot. Also it has another disadvantage that it can not shoots a video more than 8 minutes in a single shot. I mean long videos recording cannot supported by this camera.Apart from above picture quality is good.

						Hey Don't buy this product. Its very slow. It will take too much time between two pictures. Even if you zoom in or zoom out once u can not immediately zoom in and zoom out. You have to wait for 5 to 8 secs.. Not Good Don't Buy this....

<specsKey name="reviewText">
						The camera doesn't give clear photos but stil have some good modes like sunset and sunrise modes...I would suggest a 16 mp camera with a good lens for those who are looking for good photos. .. the camera is below average but I got it with a free good hand watch (UCB), a 4GB memory card and a camera case in very good price about RS 5500/- ... so over all I can rate it as average. .
