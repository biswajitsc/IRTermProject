<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Too slow!!</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">
						This camera S6600 did not turn out what its supposed to be! -Huge delay between clicks- Full charge does not last even for 100 shots- Motion blur reduction does not work effectively - shots come out blurNot liking it..had bought this as replacement for another nikon S610 that got damaged accidentally. Would prefer canon any day

						Flipkart ensured that the product was delivered within the timeframe promised and in proper working condition. This is a great camera to own for an amateur photographer who needs an effective point-and-shoot model.
