<specsKey name="reviewText">I am using this camera for the last 7 days and i must say it is one of the best in its class.Awesome features,zoom(it is difficult to control more than 10x without tripod)CMOS Sensor.I want to admit one thing that if u r looking for a camera with manual settings of course this is not the one.But otherwise it has all the great things and the shooting modes(many of them)also makes the best pictures in different situation.And last but not the least thing is it is a very handy camera with great features.I just carry it in my pocket.I am enjoying and loving the every moment of this great camera!!!!So if u looking for a handy camera with cool features and great picture quality(u must use the shooting modes correctly to have the best out of it) just go for it with out any doubt in ur mind!!!!TRUST          ME U WILL BE EXCITED!!!!!!!!</specsKey>

						This is an awesome product since it features a CMOS sensor which other POS lack. -Images are blur-free even at night and the night landscape features work like magic. -Video recording is also top-notch. Battery life is also very good.-It features a super cool macro shot of 1cm which you won't find in any other brand so easily at this price.-Sexy yet sophisticated looks (with that pop-up flash).-Just make sure not to drop it. I had dropped mine and it was showing 'lens error' though I got it repaired under warranty :)-If your budget is
