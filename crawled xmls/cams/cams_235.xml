<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Nice piece of tech for the given price</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">The camera is light weight, fits comfortably in the palm. The strap provided keeps it safe from dropping off from the hand while taking photos in a hurried manner. The macro feature is very good and gives really good quality close photographs, which is predominantly the main type of photos I tend to click. The camera's 16 Mega pixel gives really good photographs at the digital camera levels, the ISO has a fair range and enhances the picture quality.I really feel comfortable and happy using the wifi feature in the camera by which it creates a hotspot and smartphones (Android and iOS based) can be connected using the app available free of charge. This smartphone pairing helps in taking photos from a distance. Not only is the display shared on the mobile phone but the taken photos are saved to the phone as well and one can view the already existing photos in the memory card. On the whole, I would recommend this product.</specsKey>
