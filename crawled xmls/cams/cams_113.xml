<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Ultimate.... Awesome Mini DSLR...!</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">Just Class apart.Amazing, DSLR level quality.I am using this alongside my DSLRs (Nikon D5100/ Nikon D5200).Whenever I don't want to go out with a Heavy DSLR, I just put this pocket rocket in my pocket and go out for some awesome photography....Great Low light photography, noise free even in darkest and night conditions.RAW image support, a really good feature for editing.FHD Videos are very nice too.Battery life is little limited though, for long outdoor shoots or vacation trips better take 1 extra battery.Still 150-200 shots are Ok for most users.Do not hesitate to buy. U will just love this camera.</specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">excellent camera</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">I spent a lot of time looking at many camera reviews before deciding to buy P340. The optical zoom is only 5, but this camera is meant for people who want image quality rather than excessive zoom. In most high zoom cameras the image quality deteriorates with zoom due to camera shake, difficulty in auto-focus etc., so I figured there is little point in that. P340 is a bridge camera in that it combines the advantage of comprehensive manual and automatic settings with pocketable size, as well as features seen in expensive cameras like RAW format. The lens ring can be also configured for aperture/EV/shutter control and makes manual photography easier. The picture quality is excellent because of the larger sensor, and noise is less even at ISO 800. I have experimented a couple of months with various settings and the results are good. Cons:1. Battery is charged in camera, so I had to buy an extra charger for the EN-EL-12 battery. 2. Control knobs are small.</specsKey>

						the picture quality of the camera is really good.no need to use flash even under low light,but the camera case supplied with the camera is really small and difficult to put your camera inside it.the zipper scratches the edges of the camera.would be happy if i get my camera case replacement with a proper one

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">P340 good buy</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">The P340 was best fit in the requirement and budget, as I was interested in compact camera which can take better quality photos. Below is my experience with the camera:a) It is not slow like a mid range point&amp;shoot and not fast like DSLRb) The auto mode sometimes does not selects the correct picture mode, specially while taking indoor photographs (low light condition)c) Camera settings are complex, it took a while to learn (My wife did not like the hassle of setting to take better picture unfortunately the auto mode is not doing the job well)  (the alternative is to select scene manually like portrait, landscape, indoor etc this will give you best results)d) If camera settings are alright,the low light photos taken by camera are excellente) Macro mode photographs are stunningf) Takes better picture compare to any point and shoot camera available upto 23000 Range.g) battery indicator is not so good it will keep you guessing how much juice is left in the camera. It will just indicate that battery is low not sure how many shots can be taken once low indicator starts blinkingh) the display has some while shadow at the corner, i read some other reviews and people were complaining about it so I did not care to get it fixed as it is not causing any issue with the photographs</specsKey>

						nice camera.. worth the buy... if you know little photography this will be worth ,,capturing macros or far objects or moving objects works great..small form factor very close to DSLR features.if u dont like bulky DSLR and want to go for smaller body this one makes it worth the buy..tried it for a month...almost so its worth the buy..@ price wise little costly but its worth the price may be 2 k less would be idle price. around 15k..

						If looking for something compact and close to DSLR.. then this should be a choice. In competition sony Hx60v is good travel zoom type camera but u won't find this good aperture range from f1.8 there.. all in all good deal in under 18 k.

						This camera is very compact but the photos taken through this camera are excellent especially low light photos are great. Those who like to take low light photos i recommend this camera to them. Cool feature of this camera is lens control ring and the built in wi-fi.I can't find any cons in this camera till now.
