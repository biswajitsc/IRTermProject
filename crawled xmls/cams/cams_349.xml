<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Dat Resolution</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">I finally pulled the trigger and got myself a D800e. To most people, D800 might seem like a more attractive proposition with it's lower price and the inclusion of an AA filter. To me that would be a huge mistake. It's not often one would buy a full frame Dslr, especially an amateur. It only makes sense to get the best possible one even though it's a tiny bit pricy. As for the lack of anti aliasing filter is concerned, I can tell you from experience and research that moire is a non issue.The only thing I was concerned about is the extreme left focus point issues, but after getting my camera and testing it thoroughly it seems my copy is not afflicted by this issue. I hear nikon has updated their focus point calibration process and sendai after the initial backlash and that these problems are a thing of the past.  If you are trying to decide between the D800 or the D800e, go for the D800e if resolution is what you are looking for. Either camera is a winner and you can't go wrong with them. </specsKey>
