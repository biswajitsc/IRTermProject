<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Great camera - crappy customer service</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">Nikon D7000 is a feature packed DSLR and I had a chance to walk with this product for few months - thanks to my friend. Its a solid built, great working camera.This could ba great UPGRADE for you if you are already using a Nikon entry DSLR and used to Nikon Menu systems. Else its exposure, menu system and weight can be quite overwhelming for you (if you are beginner) - and  might land up somewhere in your cupboard - sooner or later.Rather than scanning feature sheets and getting nowhere, do take your time to visit store and check the camera for yourself. And well, do hunt for local Nikon customer care numbers .. they are pretty rare in most Indian cities.</specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Awesome DSLR..!!</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">Hi Guys,Nikon D7000 is a great upgrade from one of the best DSLR by Nikon - D90. I never thought they would come up with such a great product which is in between D90 and D300. Twin memory, great battery life - You can shoot whole day by charging the battery only once. Great image quality. I love RAW shooting. I like the placement of exposure and focus lock button. The grip is amazing.There is no doubt that this is a fantastic piece of photographic engineering. Itâ€™s has a huge array of features that could even give pro cameras 5 times its price a run of their money. I have been impressed with the camera start to finish and love the new 39 point auto focus system which opens up a whole new world of creativity.You can see why the camera has been so well received since its release picking up 4 huge awards so far in 2011. The camera does offer exceptional value for money and if you are looking to purchase a new DSLR in the future then I can strongly recommend this as a front runner.</specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Awesome camera...</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">Brilliant camera.... Just upgraded from a Nikon D3100 which I had for almost 3 yrs and learnt a lot. Am really impressed by this upgrade. This is for those who have gone beyond entry-level and are willing to explore more and are looking for a bit extra but don't want to shed out a sack full of money. If you have the extra cash do go for the D7100.... its an upgraded model but with that one drawback which is the buffer which causes the burst speed to suffer. Other than that it is a better model than the D7000 but also more expensive. But this camera is just bang on the buck. Just one thing.... I did not get it from flipkart because I found it expensive here. I got it from a multi-brand retailer for 42k (with warranty and papers) whereas the price on flipkart is 49900/- (as on 03.10.2013). But as for the camera goes it is an absolute delight for semi-pro photographers.</specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">A good choice for LOW LIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY :) </specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">Don't think much if you loves low light photography this will help you to shoot in low light with out a flash.Go for D7000... Am using a 50mm 1.8D lens. Clarity is mind-blowing and more important to me is satisfaction, Yes am very satisfied with the results given by the camera. I don't know much about photographic techniques. Exposure metering provided is a great help for me. It helps me to set the shutter speed and aperture settings in manual mode. Battery life is excellent. In low light also its focus the object very quickly. Flipkart - now your packing is avg.A thin paper box with a thin air bubble covering. </specsKey>
