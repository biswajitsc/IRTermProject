<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Really a poor Product</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">
						The product is packed with huge amount of specification but none of this of use. 21 MP camera at such a low price was doubtful but I took chance and it proved that low price can not accomodate the higher configurations. Pictures gets blurred after zooming even upto 3X. Flash is not that much effective as it should have. Looks cute and handy and easily fits in the hands but the picture quality is a huge dissappointment.

						This was my first buy from flipkart.... n was really happy receiving such a great device. It had more than I have expected. Really owns a variety of modes to click scenes and very nice image quality. Has good video recording. Moreover, has slim and smart look, light-weighted, easy to carry and handle. Just love it. :)

						Easy to use and good quality pictures and a good compact camera. Charging the battery has to be done with the camera which is a little inconvenient.
