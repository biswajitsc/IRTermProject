<specsKey name="reviewTitle">An Over Rated Shoot !</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">
						After using it for about an year, I can for sure say that this camera didn't performed as expected.The poor lens(wide angle),unnecessary features and over pricing (16.5 K at the time of launch)makes it totally an dull choice.
