						:)Awesome pic quality @ nit thanx to BIS sensor.And pic stabilization is also very good overall performance is very good,  but :( have small battery does not last long, 4gb card is not sufficient for 16 mega pics as it is class four so data rate is also slow.

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">MUST READ......WHY THIS CAMERA ONLY???????</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">I WILL FIRST LIKE TO THANKS FLIPKART people for there lightning fast delivery. I ordered it on 27NOV2012 in afternoon...and m amazed that the camera was in my hand on next day afternoon i.e. on 28NOV2012 afternoon.GUYS BUY ONLY NIKON...IT GIVES VALUE FOR MONEY AND KEEP ITS PROMISE IN THE QUALITY............now the question why to buy only this camera.....GENERAL ADVANTAGES:-1). Light weight2). Small Size3). looks cool in hands4). portableTECHNICAL ADVANTAGES1). 10* ZOOM WITH "FULL" AUTO FOCUSING AND AUTO FOCUSING. 2). FULL HD RECORDING IN 1080p (HIGHEST RESOLUTION).3). ADVANCE SENSOR FOR BETTER PHOTOGRAPHY.4). BATTERY CAN BE CHARGE BY THE USB CABLE BY AC ADAPTER OR BY       COMPUTER/LAPTOP.5). PROBLEM FOR CHARGING IS SOLVED AS BATTERY GET CHARGE INSIDE THE CAMERA WITH SUPPLY LIKE MOBILES.6). GIVES HIGHEST QUALITY OF PHOTOGRAPH IN FULL DARK WITHOUT NOISE.(BETTER ISO RATING)7). ALL THE SCENE MODE IN THE CAMERA WORKS GOOD.9). BEST CHARGING OPTION : BY COMPUTER/LAPTOP USING USB CABLE OR BY AC ADAPTER10) 3D PHOTOGRAPHY11). SUPPORT 4GB,8GB,16GB AND 64GB MEMORY CARD.12). PANORAMA FEATURES. 13) BEST NIGHT PHOTOGRAPH, NEGLIGIBLE NOISE,     (IF U TAKE PHOTO IN DARK ROOM, STILL IT TAKE PHOTO IN SUCH A WAY THAT YOU ARE IN THE STUDIO WITH PROPER LIGHT)14) POWERFUL FLASH DISADVANTAGE; 1). ACCORDING TO ME I THINK THAT ITS LITTLE COSTLY BUT IF U WANT AWESOME PICTURE QUALITY THEN YOU MUST HAVE TO CHOOSE IT.NOTE : FRIENDS I HAVE CHECKED NIKONS FOLLOWING CAMERA1) NIKON L3102) NIKON L8103) NIKON L254) NIKON L265) NIKON S64006) NIKON S9100BUT TRUST ME MY FRIENDS THESE CAMERA HAVE MANY PROBLEMS i.e. battery problem, size problem, price problem, less pixel, sm providing only 720p hd recording, and those who is giving 1080p is much costly.!!!!!so guys i will say if u dnt have more money then go for NIKON COOLPIX L26 but if you have little more buDget ...go for NIKON COOLPIX S6300......................NITHER SONY, CANNON, KODAK ,FUJIFLIM , OLYMPUS NOR ANY COMPANY CAN PROVIDE YOU SUCH DRASTIC EXPERIENCE IN THIS AMOUNT. FOR CHOOSING THIS CAMERA I LITERARY TOOK 3 WHOLE NIGHT FOR SEARCHING FOR IT...ITS ONE TIME INVESTMENT FILL WITH HOPE........NW U DECIDE WHAT U WANT.......!!!!!!!!!!</specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Nice product within the range</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">First of all i would like to thank FLIPKART(and the courier aswell) for this amazing product and delivering it at our doorstep within the stipulated time.[I received my product on 3rd day of placing my order(despite being a sunday).Well coming to the product, NIKON COOLPIX S6300,its a wonderful product within the price range 10k.It is very handy,comfortable,stylish,portable and very much suitable for personal use.I am a naive user,i dont know much technicalities about cam,but i find it extremely user friendly,easy to use and it stands upto my expections.This product(being 16mp) gives excellent pictures.When pictures shot with proper conditions, it gives HDR pics which really amazing and one would think those pics are taken from slr cameras.This camera has 19modes of shooting, you can explore it as and when u like.[those who want to experiment and do sum photography work].I find auto scene mode to be very useful as per my requirement.Only problm iz dat it has average battery lyf(when fully charged around 220 shot, as flash drains away its charge).It has a very good flash light quality which iz effective upto 5 mtrs raduis.It has 10x zoom(optical)n 4x (digital), which can zoom object at a distance of 15 feet conveniently.It gives a very good video hd quality.so, ultimatly this turns out to be a very good product as this many features.one more thing i want to say,before using this product (if possible) please read its manual if u want it to deliver its best,in my case it took me almost one day or 30  shots to set my hands on it(for proper timigs and best shots).Now i am enjoying and hav no regret for this product.This is the best choice if you have budget under 10k,if not then i would recommend to go for nikon L310 or L810[if u r luking for dslr cameras which comes with hardly a difference of 2k(unless price matters to u)].</specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Good camera with significant drawback</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">First about Flipkart:Good:- Excellent delivery time. Just within two days.- HDMI cable is very useful.Bad:- 4GB card is no use for me; it's very old one. I bought new SanDisk Ultra Class 10 SDHC 16GB memory card for this.- e-Gift voucher takes 10 working days; absolutely ridiculous!About Camera -Pros:1. It's a very Lightweight and easy to carry.2. Good picture quality.3. Good flashlight.4. HDMI port.5. Full HD 1080p video recording - none of the other camera have 1080p at this price tag.6. Capture speed is too good.7. Easy to use camera.Cons:1. Average LCD screen.2. Very poor LCD UI interface. Looks like 1980 MS-DOS program.3. Lens shift vibration does not work at all.4. It captures lens zooming sound also.5. Full HD quality is average. I am not impressed at all. Was expecting far better quality.6. Red eye reduction does not work everytime.7. Build quility looks very average.8. Some cases low light capture is not so good.9. Low internal memory.</specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Really cool and amazing camera within the price range</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">I bought this camera and got it delivered very soon by flipkart. I must say the camera is worth the price paying.It's Zoom is really good. I took a pic at full zoom and was amazed with the quality of the pic so clear. And if you take a lot of pics in low light then this camera is a really for you. The images in low light are taken really well. Functions are very easy. This is a starting series and should not be compared with DSLR's. If you are comparing the camera with the DSLR then you will definitely be disappointed. The image clarity is really good.I got a 4 gb memory card with this camera which is ok, not so great since the speed of the camera is slow. If you find that the camera is working slow then you should replace the memory card with a higher class memory card. It is not a camera issue.I liked one of the features in which you can select the colour and click image. Everything apart from that colour comes black and white. It's really cool.I just missed the gift voucher from flipkart. If I would have placed the order 2 days later I would have got the voucher :( but its ok.To summarize its worth paying the amount. AND do not compare with the DSLR's for image quality.</specsKey>
