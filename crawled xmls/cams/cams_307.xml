<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Pure Devil!</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">The first thing I want to say to anybody who is even considering my opinion - don't let the comparisons with other higher models cloud your judgement about this camera!!! THIS CAMERA IS ALL YOU NEED FOR ANY LEVEL OF PHOTOGRAPHY.If you know how to bring out the best out of this camera then this camera would totally overwhelm you. Agreed that the settings aren't really easy to mess with if you want to optimise this camera but its the hardware that matter the most which is just superb! The sensor is amazing and the RAW (NEF) compression format, even though is compressed 12-bit (and not uncompressed), has barely any difference with the uncompressed RAW image format which is actually beyond expectations.Tweak a few settings here and there and you can even get quality photos that can somewhat compete (don't expect it to outperform) with the high end ones. I found the ISO a bit noisy at higher ISOs and the Hi1 and Hi2 settings are definitely noisy as hell but you also have to consider that this camera is not a high end one (cut some slack!). But otherwise a 24 Megapixel with 24.1 bit depth is astonishingly impressive!The active D-Lighting is an interesting feature in these models and even thought it is accompanied by grain, but I find that grain aesthetic. You can put this grain to positive use and not be too rigid about it.The White balance has loads of presets with fine-tunings! In the long run, you will likely find a favourite white balance and stick to it (Mine is a to-and-fro between Sunlight, Cloudy and Shade. I almost never use Fluorescent or Incandescent unless I am doing certain type of product photography but its personal choice really)One other setting I love to play around with is the Picture Control - that baby is a gold mine!To sum up, I have owned this camera for about a month and I have got awesome results. I bought this camera after extensive research and it may have a reputation of a beginner's DSLR but if you mess around well in Manual mode, you will find hidden wonders this camera can do (honestly, if you can't photography good with this camera in normal conditions, its not the camera's fault - you have to consider the fact that a camera is as good as the photographer).</specsKey>
