<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Worst digital cam</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">
						Never go for this cam. Literally you got to wait at-least 30-40 secs for every consecutive shot. Its taking more time to process and store pics into the memory. That will make you crazy.Finally this is the worst product I ever got from flipkart.

<specsKey name="reviewText">
						Delivery took 3 days and I was fine with that.The Camera came with all essentials - batteries, charger, a pouch, memory card and Timex watch.But photo capture time is very slow, after taking pics to normal it take about 7-8secs to process.so have to wait 7-8 secs to take another pic.Photo clarity is good.videos is 720p which is good and qulity is 'Fine' .

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Good Product in this price range</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">
						 At this budget this is close to the best you can get.  It takes good photos. Video is good..  Shutter could have been a little better. Quality suffers in low light but that is understandable..  But the problem I had is with delivery and a dreadful customer service.. THESE GUYS JUST ANSWER THE PHONE AND DO NOTHING.. I think only BSNL is worse than them.. So my review is only for the product rest is ridiculous.

						Average performance at this price. Picture quality is good, Zoom is okay. I am not too impressed with the shutter speed though. it works fine in a well lit atmosphere however in low light it didnt impress me
