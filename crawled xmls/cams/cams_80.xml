<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Nikon Coolpix is Cool</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">I own this camera from since 1-year, and i am feeling great with Coolpix L310. Here are some points you would like to note down this product.1. 21x optical zoom:-                      The main reason i buy this cam was its optical zoom capacity and 21x zoom, its huge.If you move into Hilly Areas then you will realize the presence of Coolpix L310. It reduces 1-mile distance to 10-meter. But you also have to buy a cam stand, because as the zooming increases variations in capturing image also raises due to hands.2. 14.1 Mp:-             However there are a lot of cams in this price lot and even in lesser one with 14.1 Mp , but that thing is compromise-able. picture quality is really good.3. Semiprofessional Look :-                           As you can see that it have a professional cams look which can attract you , however i have Coolpix in Red color. But after all i love it.4. Battery Backup:-                   i will say that its average. if you are going for a tour i will recommend you to bring a set of non-rechargeable battery cells. cells take 4-6 hours to completely charge and they can live long depending on your usage. One day i bring it to a party and of course i use flash, but after all i was able to take around 250 pics and battery still alive. So i must say that for one day you can use it roughly.5. video recording:-                    well like all other digital cams u can't use flash while recording video. so you need external flash light. But with Coolpix L310 u can record videos with 760pix. and it feels like you are recording a movie(that's depend how you record :p). Its fine for me .6. Pricing:-            i bought this product last year at the festival of diwali(not from flipkart). I take it from my friend's store which cost me Rs.13200/- plus a diwali gift voucher(hand watch). So finally i will recommend you that if you are buying this product for tours and travel then it will be good for you. otherwise its all up to you.</specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Worth Buying Nikon L310 Point and Shoot</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">I bought this Camera recently 1 month back with 4GB Card + Carry bag + rechargeable kit with 4 battery.The best points that i like in this camera is ...1. The flash power is very strong as it uses 4 batteries even in total dark.2. Vibrating or running image can be captured perfectly in sports mode.3. 14.1 Megapixel with 21x optical zoom is very sharp for any enviornment for a point and shoot camera at this price.4. Using Auto Mode give a very bright image with more color sharpness and clarity.5. The CCD image sensor gives a perfect image even in running mode.6. The battery backup is really amazing as i already took almost 50 snaps day\night and still its active.If you are planning to buy a reasonable came just go for it.//ProdyotBangalore</specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">L310 is Not a Bridge, but it's really a Bride</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">
						The L310 from Nikon family is a budget camera for a serious photographer who is tired on carrying SLRs during family outings.It gives the pleasure of using a Bigger Lense Camera with a great 21X optical zoom, while compact in operation even for a novice.The colours are very natural with a perfect and faster focusing.One should not forget to carry a mini tripod to have more control while shooting the distant objects.The lacuna in it is the vibration while using the zoom control as well as occasional out focus during the video recording.

<specsKey name="reviewText">
						Thanks to Flipkart for delivering the product on time. When I brought to the notice about missing SD Card, they immediately couriered it without making any fuss. Coming to the Camera, It is a wonderful one with amazing clarity and range. Even in the nights where lighting is an issue, it performs well. It has multiple modes, that serves the purpose. Strongly recommending for someone who wants a good camera but on a budget....

<specsKey name="reviewText">
						The service at flipkart is incredible, Nikon coolpix L310 is a superb camera with so many additional features that are not listed on this site, it really worth the price. 13000/- is a steal. Plus the additional goodies really make you feel its a good investment.

<specsKey name="reviewText">
bought this camera for ease of use also read up on it in a photo magazine and they rated it as capable of delivering far better quality than its price tag reflects and I have to say having owned more expensive cameras this is a great allrounder.
