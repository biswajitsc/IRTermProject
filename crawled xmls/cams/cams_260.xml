<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Awesome User Friendly Camera, Nikon-S6700.</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">At the very beginning, I would like to thank Flipkart.com for such a prompt delivery within 2 days, and that too in such a beautiful and tamper proof packaging!!I was in need of a camera, which should be more user-friendly and easy to use, and also light weight. I did various R&amp;D works over the internet, not less than 1 fortnight, and finally 2 models stood in my list, which were:i) Nikon S6700. ii) SONY-W830.I go confused about which one to opt for, and then I luckily got a link, showing the video quality of Nikon-S6700 in Youtube, after which I made my decision to simply go for this 20.1 MP and 10x Optical zoom camera.And, while I received the camera and after checking some snaps and videos, I realized that by choosing this camera, I took the RIGHT decision.A really awesome camera, with easy-to-use features and so light-weight and it easily fits in one's hand.I will recommend this to those who are searching for a Family Camera, especially or the beginners.And at last but not the least, thanks to WS-Retail, for providing this camera at a reasonable price, as compared to other sellers.Note : Battery takes upto 2.30 Hours to get charged completely (As it took in my case). And there is no separate Charging unit supplied, hence for charging the battery, you will need to connect one end of the wire to the wall socket, and the other end to your camera (In switch off mode), and obviously with the Battery inserted in it.</specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Picture clarity is low</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">
						I have purchased this from flipkart , the picture clarity of this product is very low..for every snap i was like blur.10X zoom is no use since all the pics are not having the clarity. I really not happy with this model.

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Nikon coolpix is good</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">
						Nikon coolpix is good. But some time it takes more than a minute to get ready for a take.Quality camera display is very bad, but the photos are good when you see in a system.

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Worth the price, good option in point&amp;shoot</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">
						PROS: Light weight, handy, has many features to play around with snaps. Clarity is the best feature. Added benefits of free camera case and 4 GB SD card saved the trouble of hunting for them separately.CONS: Slow in processing pics after they are taken, needs around 3-4 seconds to finish recording the snap. Has auto-flash enabled by default on startup, need to disable it manually every time, as per need. Also, flash has only 2 options - auto and off. There is no on mode.Overall, good product, small discrepancies that can be ignored.

						User Friendly device. Excelent service by Flipkart. The Camera box was sealed at the time of delivery, which shows that the device is original. all the belongs in the box were sealed and not opened with a warranty card in it. GREAT

						Deadly slow processing while capturing photos. Display quality s not up to the mark. After taking one pic, it will tk again a mnit to process and to get ready for the next. So moments will not wait till the camera get ready to capture it..
