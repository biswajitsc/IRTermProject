<specsKey name="reviewTitle">good choice</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">Ordered on 2/7/13 and received on 6/7/13. Thanks to flipkart.I was confused between nikon L320, sony DSC H100 and H200, Panasonic Lumix LZ20.After looking at the reviews i found the sony's are popular and are superhits, whereas the panasonic has got good reviews too, then when i came to the price i found the panasonic is the cheapest with almost similar specifications with the rest. Now about the Nikon L320 i was in a big dilemma as there were few reviews available. Then suddenly on 2/7/13 while i was browsing i found that the price of this cam slashed which attracted me towards it and looking at its predecessor and brand name i was very much convinced to purchase this product. And i must say i made a good choice.Though there are some mistakes in the features of this camera mentioned here in flipkart. I want to say that this camera has "panorama assist" not "easy panorama" but it does not matter much as the software provided with this camera very smoothly makes very nice panoramic images.It does not have the 3D photography which is also mentioned in flipkart.Other then this two issues i Dont have any complaints about this beautiful piece.The best part is its zoom, its just awesome, Even in video the zoom does the wonders.The picture quality is superb and flash is very powerful, even in a dark room u can takes pictures that look like as if taken on a bright sunny outdoor.Finally i would like to say that i am very much satisfied and happy with the product</specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Nikon doesnt need any rating, it is d best one :)</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">
						got d product in just 2 days.flipkart service is best as usual.Nikon Coolpix L320 is a successor of Nikon Coolpix L810.i wanted to order L810 but L810 is permanently discontinued and L320 is introduced in its place with almost same features.Undoubtedly Nikon products are pretty good.dis product have some pretty features, like 26x optical zoom,720p recording,red eye fix,vibration reduction nd many more.moreove 13k is a decent price for d features L320 provides :)blindly go for it :)

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Just LOVE it!!</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">I got it as a birthday gift, and I just love this camera. I have clicked so many amazing pictures with this camera that some of my friends didn't believe that a camera in this price range has done such a good job! I simply find it my perfect partner for wildlife photography. For someone who wants to go for a professional photography, this might not be the first choice because it takes couple of more seconds to click than a lot of DSLRs but otherwise for everyone else it can be a great longterm buy. Just great for all my photography needs. First time you might take general pictures with it, but if you go ahead and try out all its features you will be surprised what amazing pictures it can take. One of my friends had a DSRL with a stylish looking huge long lens, and out of the pictures we both took, I won! One big reason was its zoom which even that DSLR with the huge lens also could not give. Its all about how much time you spend to understand your camera and there you have it all!! Hope you enjoy it, as i do!! :)</specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Cost effective solution to good quality OUTDOOR DAYTIME photography</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">I usually go to tours twice a year and I love to shot landscape, birds and animals. At this point of time I can not afford to buy a DSLR so settled for this one after reviewing the specs of this camera and similar cameras of other manufacturers. After few days of buying this camera I went to Sundarbans, WB for a short trip and got chance to test the capacity of the camera.PROS:1. Excellent optical zoom.2. Excellent autofocus.3. Very good battery life.4. Portrait and indoor photo quality are pretty decent.CONS:1. Shake compensation not very satisfactory.2. Bad night time outdoor photo quality even at very close range.3. Flash tends to burn the image in Macro mode.Overall a smart purchase for the people who require cost efficient, lightweight camera with good zoom.</specsKey>

<specsKey name="reviewText">
						i bought this product 4 months back. It is very easy to use. Very comfortable for handling. sometimes the photos look like DSLR pics !!! video recording is ok. face detection and auto focus will take some time. battery life is pretty good.If you are a normal user and you want good pics in easy way this is the one you are looking for.....
