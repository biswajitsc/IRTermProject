<specsKey name="reviewTitle">very good at this price</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">i purchased this yesterday from a local store for 17.5k.This camera is realy awsome..but donot realy pump your expectation like a dslr camera,but it definitly does the job if you are new in photography..pictures  in low light has a promlem to keep in focus and slight shaky hands will find dificulty to take perfect pictures(specialy in macro shot).flash is awsome and helps a lot to take amazing pictures...better use night mode if you are clicking pictures of moon in night..at full zoom you will not get a perfect steady shot,so selection night mode will fix this issue....daylight pictures are awsome over all picture quality,if taken perfectly will bolw your mind...no wifi,view finder is a steal,it has manual control as well as auto,operation is very simple and easy(anyone can operate without problem....go for it for this price value</specsKey>
