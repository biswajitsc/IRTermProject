<specsKey name="reviewTitle">Good camera within your reach...</specsKey>
<specsKey name="reviewText">First I would like to thank Flipkart for their good services. They delivered me withing 2 days. I ordered on Wednesday night it was delivered on Friday morning.This camera is good in terms of it's price. It has lots of feature.While taking your picture you can set ur mode according to the environment.Night mode, Beach, Fireworks, Pet and many more.HD videos you can shoot.After taking the snap you can adjust it's clarity, brightness, your face glamor and many thing, which is awesome within this price.Smile timer is there which will take the snap when you smile. Best Shot Selection(BSS) and multiple picture features also included in this model.Drawback is: Panaroma is there but you need a software to join the photos.In short I am very satisfied with the product. Don't stay back go for it. Cheers!!! </specsKey>
